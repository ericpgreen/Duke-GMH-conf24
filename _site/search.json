    "text": "Addressing mental health in the community: Implementation of research and practice from the Southern US to the Global South\n4th floor, Classroom 4067 (video)\nA key objective of implementation science is increasing the accessibility and adoption of evidence-based practices and programs into health systems and communities. Mental health is increasingly recognized as both a negative health outcome and as a contributor to other negative health outcomes. Correspondingly, implementation studies may address mental health in different ways, ranging from screening to incorporating mental health into other programs to directly targeting mental health as a primary outcome. Importantly, a critical cross-cutting theme is engagement with the community at all stages of implementation. In this symposium, we will highlight different ways in which implementation science is addressing mental health in community-based settings, with focus on the role of community partnering and engagement at varying stages of implementation.\nChair: Christine L Gray, Assistant Research Professor, Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research\nDiscussant: Susan Reif, Research Scholar, Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nPresenter\n\n\n\n\nCommunity informed adaptation and implementation of a mental health and substance use screening and referral process in HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) care in the US Deep South\nSusan Reif\n\n\nImplementing positive youth development and sexuality education to address health disparities in rural North Carolina\nGenevieve (GV) Hunter\n\n\nMental Health of Indigenous Gay and Bisexual Men in Guatemala: a qualitative study\nLucia Weyer Johnson\n\n\nEnhancing Peer Support in Medical Spaces for Substance Dependency and Harm Reduction Among LGBTQIA+ Individuals in the South\nJemm Merritt"

The second study examines the impact of prior maternal adversity on mental health during COVID-19 in rural Pakistan, finding that pre-pandemic adversity increased vulnerability but did not exacerbate mental health outcomes.

In this symposium, we will use ongoing and completed mental health studies to highlight features and challenges in several trial designs, including preference trials, individually-randomized group treatment trials and stepped wedge trials with the goal to engage in a discussion with the audience around what important features to pay attention to when designing such trials.\nChair and Discussant: Elizabeth (“Liz”) Turner, Associate Professor of Biostatistics & Global Health, Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics and DGHI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nPresenter\n\n\n\n\nDesign and analysis of preference trials in mental health research\nAlyssa Platt\n\n\nDesign and analysis of individually randomized group treatment trials in mental health research\nJohn Gallis\n\n\nTime-varying treatment effects in mental health research\nAvi Kenny\n\n\nAddressing the Global Mental Health Care Gap for Adolescents Living with HIV: Transferrable Lessons South to North\nDorothy Dow"
